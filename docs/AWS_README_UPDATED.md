# AWS Deployment - Updated Approach

## ⚠️ Update: Switched from Elastic Beanstalk to Amplify

We originally tried **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, but encountered timeout issues with Docker deployments on t3.micro instances.

## ✅ New Approach: AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify is **much better** for React applications:
- Faster deployments (3-5 min vs 15-20 min)
- Free forever (not just 12 months)
- No server management
- Purpose-built for React/static sites
- Simpler setup
